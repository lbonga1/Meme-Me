# Meme-Me
A simple app for creating and sharing memes.

Users can either choose an image from their photo album or take a new picture (if their device has a camera).
Text fields are provided for the top and bottom of the image, and the user is able to share their completed meme.
Sent memes are displayed in a table view and collection view. The user can select a meme to be shown a detail view.
